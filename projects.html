        <h2>Virtual Pet Shelter</h2>
        <p>In this virtual pet shelter game, players are responsible for taking care of both robotic and organic pets, which have different sets of needs. The user also has the ability to adopt a pet of their choice out of the shelter, and to admit a pet of their choice into the shelter.
            (I plan on building this project into a fully functional web application using REST & Java script)

		<h2>ATM with Exchange Rate Feature</h2>
		<p>This ATM program written in Java includes an exchange rate feature that allows the user to convert their funds from one currency to another. In this program, the user is given four options: Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, or Exit. The program maintains the user's account balance and allows them to deposit or withdraw funds. 
            It acts as a normal ATM system like we would use in real life, with an added bonus for fun! This program is a Java class that contains instance variables and methods that simulate an ATM. It uses the Scanner class to read user input from the console, and a switch statement to determine which method to call based on the user's input. The program also includes basic error handling for cases where the user attempts to withdraw more money than they have in their account. The program is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear prompts and instructions for the user at each step. </p>

        <h2>Triva Game</h2>
		<p>In this game, the user is asked four trivia questions and provided with four options for each question. The user's answer is gathered and the program keeps track of their score based off how many questions are answered correctly. At the end of the game, the user's final score is displayed.
            This program uses an ArrayList to store a dynamic number of Question objects. It uses a for-each loop to iterate through the questions in the list, and calls accessor methods on each Question object to get the prompt and answer fields. The program also uses a separate class, TriviaQuestion, to encapsulate the data and behavior of each question. This helps to improve the program's organization and maintainability, and allows for easier expansion or modification of the program in the future.
            Note that this game is just a simple example and can be expanded to include more questions, categories, and features like time limits, hints, or lifelines.</p>

        <h2>Adventure Game</h2>
		<p>In the main game loop, the player is given a choice of three actions: explore, check their inventory, or quit the game. If the player chooses to explore, the game simulates a random chance of finding an item, and adds the item to the player's inventory. If the player chooses to check their inventory, the game displays the contents of the inventory. Finally, if the player chooses to quit the game, it will exit the loop and end the game.</p>
